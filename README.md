# What is this?
It's a biological tool, that helps to calculate all
EFM (elementary flux modes) in a given metabolic pathway.
Metabolic pathway should be modeled as a directed graph
with weights 0 and 1, where 0 means activation and
1 means inhibition.

# How does it work?
For detailed explanation please refer to the article [article_name]


For concrete examples in the code refer to `tests/tests_integration_stoic.py`.
This file contains examples of input graphs and
corresponding output of stoichiometric matrices.

# How do I use it?
